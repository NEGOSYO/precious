        You're the moon that glows in the sky
        Lighting up the world when it's blue
        Stars they dance though late in the night
        Don't you know they dance just for you
        There you are above darkened clouds
        Smiling at the world from afar
        With the stars you wander around
        May they follow you wherever you are
        Here I am just another boy
        Singing songs that others have sung
        Trying to find the words to employ
        To adore the goddess of love
        Oh you got me in a daze yeah
        No it's not another phase
        You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
        And it's all because
        I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I
        Can't speak no I
        Can't speak at all
        I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise
        Don't think that you can hide it from me
        Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine
        Oh I can't breathe no I can't breathe at all
        Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh
        Could you please be mine oh mine
        Here you are I've waited so long
        Hoping you would sit down to stay
        'Cause with these stars I've been dancing along
        Like a fool so you'd look my way
        You're the moon that glows in the sky
        Lighting up the world when it's blue
        And here I sing though late in the night
        Hope you know I sing just for youYou're the moon that glows in the sky
